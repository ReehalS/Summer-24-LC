# Summer-24-LC
Summer 2024 Leetcode

Each folder contains the solutions in any language I have done them in.
Each solution file also contains the runtime (% beat), memory (% beat).
They also contain notes or comments for alternate solutions in the same language.

### Notes:
Some of the earlier C++ solutions need to be redone with knowledge I have gained since doing those problems.
These re-submits will be done in Python.
