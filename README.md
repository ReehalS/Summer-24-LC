## Leetcode Solutions
Solutions for Leetcode problems I've solved recently

- Each folder contains the solutions in any language I have done them in.
- Each solution file also contains the runtime (% beat), memory (% beat). Although I dont feel these have much significance since the %beat varies wildly from one run to another with even 2ms runtime or 20kb memory usage differences.
- They also contain notes or comments for alternate solutions in the same language.

### Notes:
- Some of the earlier C++ solutions (done in January 2024) need to be redone with knowledge I have gained since doing those problems.
- These re-submits will be done in Python or Java.

Problems are taken from the [Grind 75 site](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?hours=8&weeks=8) with parameters of 8 hours a week over a period of 8 weeks.
