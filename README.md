## Leetcode Solution

- Each folder contains the solutions in any language I have done them in.
- Each solution file also contains the runtime (% beat), memory (% beat).
- They also contain notes or comments for alternate solutions in the same language.

### Notes:
- Some of the earlier C++ solutions (done in January 2024) need to be redone with knowledge I have gained since doing those problems.
- These re-submits will be done in Python or Java.
